      <h1>Recommendation Alignment (RecAlign)</h1><br>
      <p> Recommendation systems (e.g., Twitter) optimize for grabbing your attention often to the detriment of your own well-being. Their objective is fundamentally misaligned with yours.</p>
      <p> We fight back with an open source initiative RecAlign (Recommendation Alignment). We use large language models (LLMs) to vet and remove recommendations according to your explicitly stated preference in an editable and transparent way.</p><br>
      <h2>What</h2>
      <p>We provide you with a chrome extension. You can specify your viewing preference in words such as <em>“I like reading about AI research”</em>. 
        We’ll use a large language model (LLM) to filter out recommendations that you do not wish to see.</p>

      <h2>Why</h2>
      <p>Perhaps you registered your Twitter account to read about academic research, but the moment you click on a funny meme, those will be the only thing to exist on your timeline thereafter.</p>
      <p>Perhaps you are an alcoholic striving to come clean, but the recommendation system knows you too well and suggest purchasing alcohol on every website you visit.</p>
      <p>The recurring problem is, recommendation systems knows too well who we are, but nothing about who you aspire to be. As a remedy, we believe as users, we have the right to not see what we do not wish to see, and we want to share this superpower with you via RecAlign, an open source initiative for recommendation alignment.</p>
