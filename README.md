# Recommendation Alignment (RecAlign)

- [Getting Started.](./docs/get_started/install_chrome_extension_en.md)

Recommendation systems (e.g., Twitter) optimize for your attention and spoil you to the detriment of your own well-being. Their objective is fundamentally misaligned with yours.

We are starting an open source initiative RecAlign (short for Recommendation Alignment) to address this misalignment. We use large language models (LLMs) to vet and remove recommendations according to your explicitly stated preference in a transparent and editable way.
